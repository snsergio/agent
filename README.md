To install the monitoring agent, scrap station's data and send to Prometheus, follow these steps:
- Log into the Ubuntu Station as superuser **eyeflow** make sure eyeflow user is configured as sudoer;
  > ssh eyeflow@<station's IP address>
- If DOCKER is used on the station, make sure eyeflow user is in Docker's group;
  > groups eyeflow
- For systems where (NVIDIA) GPU is available, make sure NVIDIA package and nvidia-smi are installed and run with no errors;
  > nvidia-smi
- Download the installation script at home folder;
  > wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snsergio/agent/main/install/install-monitor.sh
- Make sure the script has execution rights:
  > chmod +x install-monitor.sh
- Run the script as SUDO:
  > sudo ./install-monitor.sh
- Enter the eyeflow user's password to authorize elevation;
- Check screen messages, if any action is required, just keep all default and hit 'OK' usually navigate with 'TAB' and select with 'ENTER'
- Wait for the following message to edit collector-config:
  > Editing monitoring agent configuration file
  > 
  > Edit Monitoring Agent configuration file to reflect Edge Station requirements
  >
  > Press 'ENTER' to edit or 'CTRL-C' to cancel Monitoring Agent instalation 
  >  
- Save changes to the file:
  > 'ctrl-x', 'ENTER', 'y'
- Wait for the following message:
  >  
  > end of Metric Collector installation script
  > 
  > 'DATE' 'TIME'
  >  
  >  LOG file at: /opt/eyeflow/install/monitor-install-'date time'.log 
  >  
- Then check metric collector service status. Service should be running with no errors or warnings
  > sudo systemctl status metric-collector.service
- You may check metric collector's log file
  > cat /opt/eyeflow/monitor/monitoring-v5.log
